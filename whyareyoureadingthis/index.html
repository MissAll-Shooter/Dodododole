        <h1><u><b>The story of the brownest of bears</b></u></h1>
        <h3>By someone</h3>
        <p>Once upon a time, there was a boy. This boy had many, many toys, and he slept with all of them at once. He cared for them equally, for various reasons - take the huskies and the moose, they come as a reward from skiing - or chanchugo and spotty monster, who came from his older brother - or maybe the ones that have always been there - they all had a purpose.
            <br>
            <br>
            One in particular, Browny Brown Bear, was a skinny, weak and ugly bear. He was the most neglected (might I say, the only one to be neglected) and served no purpose. He longed for days, weeks, months, even years to be played with. "To be played with," said Hagenbu the husky, "means to become real, as quoted by Margery Williams." Brown believed this, for Hagenbu never lied.
            <br>
            <br>
            One day, something devastating happened - an earthquake struck, loosening Brown's joints to the point they could rotate 360 degrees. "Great," he thought, staring down at his disgusting body, "now I'll never be played with." And, with that, he was wrong. The boy realised Brown's agile playing potential and went for it. All day long, they played, for weeks and months too. Brown became a ninja, a hero, a wizard - but, of course, this didn't last forever.

            The boy caught covid.
            <br>
            <br>
            For days, the toys watched as their leader withered and decayed.
            <br>
            <br>
            And one day, he died.
            <br>
            <br>
            No one knew what to do, if anything. They laid there, silently weeping, for years, untouched by the boy's parents as a sign of respect. Eventually, some were sold and some were inherited by younger siblings. Unfortunately, however, one was left at the end. Browny Brown Bear sat there, reflecting on the greatest of days, the days where he was played with, and a single, genuine tear rolled down his cheek. This one tear was a seed. A seed for a new generation of toys to form under a new generation of children. This tear was a symbol - a reminder to poor, lonely Brown - of the never-ending cycle of toys' lives.
